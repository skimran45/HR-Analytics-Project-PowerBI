# HR Analytics Project using PowerBI

![](https://github.com/skimran45/HR-Analytics-Project-PowerBI/blob/031a80683f3472412d1bf03777d4e1a1676d0c51/Cover.png)

## Overview
The **HR Analytics Dashboard** presents key insights into employee attrition across departments, job roles, educational backgrounds, age groups, salary bands, and years of service within a company of 1,470 employees. The dashboard aims to identify critical patterns and factors contributing to employee turnover, enabling organizations to build more effective retention strategies.

## Objectives

* To determine the attrition rate and assess factors contributing to it.
* To segment attrition by demographics such as **age**, **education**, **job role**, and **salary**.
* To evaluate the impact of **years of service** on employee exit trends.
* To help HR identify focus areas (e.g., roles, age groups, salary bands) for improved retention efforts.
* To support strategic planning in talent management through visual summaries.

## Business Problems and Solutions

### **Business Problems:**

1. **What is the overall attrition rate, and how significant is it?**
2. **Which job roles experience the highest attrition, and why?**
3. **How do age and years of service impact attrition trends?**
4. **Does salary correlate with higher attrition rates?**
5. **Which educational backgrounds are more prone to attrition?**
6. **Are there specific job departments (Human Resources, R\&D, Sales) at higher risk?**
7. **How does employee tenure influence attrition likelihood?**
8. **Which specific job roles and age brackets should HR prioritize for retention strategies?**

## Findings and Conclusion

* **Attrition Snapshot**: Out of 1,470 employees, **237 have left**, giving a **16.1% attrition rate**, a significant indicator warranting organizational attention.
* **Job Role Impact**:

  * **Laboratory Technicians (62)** and **Sales Executives (57)** have the highest attrition numbers, indicating potential dissatisfaction or better external opportunities.
  * **Research Scientists (47)** and **Sales Representatives (33)** also show high attrition, especially in the **Sales and R\&D departments**.
* **Attrition by Education**:

  * **Life Sciences (41%)** and **Medical (32%)** graduates dominate the attrition pool, potentially due to high representation in technical roles or better external offers.
* **Age-Wise Trends**:

  * Employees aged **26–35** account for the largest attrition (116 employees), suggesting early-career professionals may be most mobile or dissatisfied.
  * Very low attrition in older age groups (e.g., **46–55**: 8 employees), likely due to increased stability or nearing retirement.
* **Salary Influence**:

  * Attrition is heavily skewed toward **lower salary bands**:

    * **163 employees earning ≤5K** have left, making this the most vulnerable group.
    * Attrition sharply declines in higher salary brackets, suggesting a strong **salary-retention correlation**.
* **Years of Service**:

  * The majority of attrition occurs in employees with **1–2 years** of service, peaking at **year 1 (44 employees)**.
  * A sharp decline is observed after 3 years, indicating that **retention improves with tenure**.
* **Departmental View**:

  * **Sales** and **R\&D** departments show elevated attrition, especially in entry-level or technician roles.
* **Slicer Utility**:

  * The dashboard offers filters for departments: **Human Resources**, **Research & Development**, and **Sales**, allowing targeted analysis for departmental interventions.

## Recommendations:

* **Retention Programs**: Focus on employees in the 1–2 year tenure bracket through onboarding support, mentorship, and career path clarity.
* **Salary Adjustment**: Consider revisiting compensation for employees earning ≤5K to improve retention.
* **Role-Specific Interventions**: Investigate root causes of high attrition in **Laboratory Technicians** and **Sales Executives**.
* **Targeted Engagement**: Create initiatives tailored to **26–35 year-olds**, who make up the majority of leavers.
* **Education-Specific Policies**: Understand career development expectations for **Life Sciences** and **Medical** degree holders.
* **Review Departmental Strategy**: Explore management practices and workload distribution in **Sales** and **R\&D** departments.
